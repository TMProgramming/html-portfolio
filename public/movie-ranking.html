<h1>The Best Film Series According to Tony</h1>

<h2>Top 3 Movie Series</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Original Star Wars Trilogy</h3>
<p>This series was the one that sparked my love of film and Sci-Fi. I will say however, I prefer the pre-specialized versions.</p>

<h3>Friday The 13th</h3>
<p>Although not all films in the series are as good as others, it still started my love of slasher films.</p>

<h3>Jason Bourne</h3>
<p>For me this is the quentessential spy thriller series. Yes, even over the 007 films as it has a much more connected and engaging storyline between the films.</p>
